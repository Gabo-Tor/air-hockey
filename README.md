# Air Hockey Simulation
This simulation is used as an environment to train and test deep learning models that would control the phyiscal robot during an air hockey game.
### Prerequisites
I would recommend using Anaconda3 Python distribution because that's the only environment the program was tested in. You can download it from: [https://www.anaconda.com/download/](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
## Installing
Clone the repository and install it as a python module:
```
git clone https://github.com/arakhmat/air-hockey
cd air-hockey
pip install .
```
While in the same directory, test the installation by running:
```
python play_air_hockey.py
```
